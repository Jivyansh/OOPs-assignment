### **Question 1:**
**What is the purpose of the main function in a C++ program?**

### **Answer:**
In a C++ program, the **`main`** function serves as the **entry point** of the program. It is the first function that gets executed when the program is run, and it marks the beginning of the program's execution. Every C++ program must have a **main function**, and it provides a structured way to start the program’s logic.

Here are the key purposes and details of the **`main`** function in C++:

1. **Program Entry Point**: 
   When the program is executed, the operating system looks for the `main` function and starts running the code inside it. Without a `main` function, the program will not run.

2. **Return Status**: 
   The `main` function can return an integer value to the operating system. By convention:
   - **`return 0;`** indicates that the program has completed successfully.
   - A non-zero return value generally indicates an error or abnormal termination.

3. **Program Flow Control**: 
   The `main` function controls the execution flow of the program. You can call other functions from `main` and organize your program's logic within it. It acts as the central point where other parts of the program are initiated.

### Example of a simple C++ program with the `main` function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;  // Returning 0 to indicate successful execution
}
```

### Key Points:
- **Return Type**: The `main` function must return an integer (`int`), which communicates the success or failure of the program.
- **Arguments**: The `main` function can optionally accept arguments:
  - **`int main()`**: No arguments.
  - **`int main(int argc, char* argv[])`**: Accepts command-line arguments (`argc` is the argument count, and `argv` is an array of arguments).

In conclusion, the purpose of the `main` function is to act as the starting point of the program and control the execution of the program, managing both the program flow and the return status.

### **Question 2:**
**What is the significance of the return type of the `main` function in C++?**

### **Answer:**
In C++, the **return type** of the `main` function is **`int`**, meaning that the function returns an integer value. The significance of the return type lies in its role in signaling the status of the program's execution to the operating system.

Here’s a breakdown of the importance of the return type of the `main` function:

### 1. **Indicating Program Status:**
   The return value of the `main` function provides feedback to the operating system or the calling process about the **success or failure** of the program's execution. By convention:
   - **`return 0;`** signals that the program has executed **successfully**. The value `0` is traditionally interpreted as **success**.
   - **`return non-zero value;`** (typically `1` or any other non-zero value) signals that the program has encountered an **error** or did not complete as expected. Non-zero values are used to indicate different types of errors, although this is often system or program-specific.

   This mechanism allows other programs or scripts (such as a shell script) to know whether the program ran correctly or failed, and they can take actions based on that return code.

### 2. **Standardized Behavior:**
   The return type of `main` as `int` is standardized by the C++ language and helps ensure that the behavior of the program is consistent across different environments. By following this convention, other software and systems can reliably interpret the return value and handle the program’s exit status appropriately.

### 3. **Communication with the Operating System:**
   When a C++ program finishes execution, the operating system uses the return value of `main` to determine how the program ended:
   - A **return value of `0`** is generally interpreted by the operating system as a normal and successful termination.
   - A **non-zero return value** (commonly `1` or higher) typically indicates some kind of error, and the operating system may log it or take corrective measures.

### 4. **Customization of Exit Codes:**
   While returning `0` is a standard way of signaling success, you can return different non-zero values to represent specific errors or conditions in your program. This is helpful for debugging and for situations where the program might be part of a larger system of programs that need to know what kind of error occurred.

### Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x = 10;
    
    if (x > 5) {
        cout << "Value is greater than 5!" << endl;
        return 0;  // Success: Return 0 to indicate the program ran successfully
    } else {
        cout << "Value is less than or equal to 5!" << endl;
        return 1;  // Error: Return non-zero to indicate an error occurred
    }
}
```

In this example:
- If `x` is greater than 5, the program will return `0`, indicating a successful run.
- If `x` were less than or equal to 5, the program would return `1`, signaling that something went wrong or the program did not execute as expected.

### Summary:
- The **return type** of `main` is `int` because it returns an integer value that indicates whether the program executed successfully or encountered an error.
- **`return 0;`** signals success, and **`return non-zero;`** signals an error.
- This return value provides a way for the operating system or other programs to determine how the C++ program ended and take appropriate actions.

**Question 3:**  
**What are two valid signatures of the main function in C++?**

**Answer:**  
1. **Standard signature with no arguments**:
   ```cpp
   int main() {
       // code
       return 0;
   }
   ```

2. **Standard signature with arguments (command-line arguments)**:
   ```cpp
   int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
       // code
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - `argc` (argument count) is the number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
   - `argv` (argument vector) is an array of C-strings (character pointers) representing the command-line arguments.

   **Question 4:**  
**What is function prototyping and why is it necessary in C++?**

**Answer:**  
**Function Prototyping** in C++ refers to declaring the function's signature (name, return type, and parameters) before its actual definition. It provides the compiler with information about the function's interface, allowing it to ensure that function calls are correctly made.

**Example of a function prototype:**
```cpp
int add(int, int);  // Function prototype
```

**Why is it necessary in C++?**
1. **Type Checking**: Function prototyping helps the compiler check the types and number of arguments passed to the function during calls. It ensures that the parameters and return types match the function's declaration, helping prevent errors.

2. **Forward Declarations**: It allows you to call functions before they are defined in the code. Without a prototype, the function must be defined earlier in the code or a compiler error will occur if the function is called before the definition.

3. **Readability and Organization**: It helps make the code more readable and organized, as the function interface is declared separately, allowing you to understand the function signature before its implementation.

Without function prototypes, the compiler may not know the correct data types or number of arguments for function calls, leading to potential runtime or compile-time errors.

---

**Question 5:**  
**How do you declare a function prototype for a function that returns an integer and takes two integer parameters?**

**Answer:**  
To declare a function prototype for a function that returns an integer and takes two integer parameters, you would write:

```cpp
int functionName(int, int);
```

- `int` is the return type.
- `functionName` is the name of the function.
- The two `int` parameters represent the two integer arguments the function will take.

For example, if the function is called `add`, the prototype would be:

```cpp
int add(int, int);
``` 

This tells the compiler that `add` is a function that will return an integer and will accept two integer parameters.

---

**Question 6:**  
What happens if a function is used before it is prototyped in C++?

**Answer:**  
If a function is used (called) before it is prototyped or defined in C++, the compiler will not know about its signature (name, return type, parameters), leading to a **compilation error**. Specifically, the compiler will generate an error indicating that it doesn't recognize the function, because it hasn't encountered any declaration or definition of that function before its use.

### Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int result = add(2, 3);  // Error: 'add' is used before being declared
    std::cout << result;
    return 0;
}

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```
In this case, the `add` function is used in `main()` before it is declared or defined. This causes a compilation error because the compiler doesn't know about the `add` function at the time it encounters the function call.

### How to fix it:
To avoid this error, you need to declare the function prototype before it is used, like so:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int add(int, int);  // Function prototype

int main() {
    int result = add(2, 3);  // Now it works because the prototype is declared
    std::cout << result;
    return 0;
}

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```
By declaring the prototype (`int add(int, int);`), the compiler knows about the function signature before its use in `main()`, and the code will compile successfully.

**Question 7:**  
**What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function in C++?**

**Answer:**

The main difference between a **declaration** and a **definition** of a function in C++ lies in the purpose and content of each:

### 1. **Function Declaration**:
A **declaration** (also known as a **prototype**) provides the compiler with information about the function’s name, return type, and parameters, but it does not include the function's body. The declaration tells the compiler what the function will look like, so it can check for correct usage, but it doesn't actually implement the function.

**Example of function declaration:**
```cpp
int add(int, int);  // Function declaration
```
- This tells the compiler that there is a function `add` that takes two `int` arguments and returns an `int`. However, the body of the function is not included.

### 2. **Function Definition**:
A **definition** includes both the declaration and the actual implementation (body) of the function. The definition provides the code that will be executed when the function is called.

**Example of function definition:**
```cpp
int add(int a, int b) {  // Function definition
    return a + b;
}
```
- This not only declares the function's signature (`int add(int, int)`) but also provides the implementation (the body) of the function.

### Key Differences:
- **Declaration**: Provides the function’s name, return type, and parameters, but no implementation. It is used for informing the compiler about the function's signature before its actual use.
- **Definition**: Contains both the function’s declaration and its implementation (the body). It is where the actual logic or code of the function is written.

### Example in Context:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Declaration (prototype)
int add(int, int);

int main() {
    std::cout << add(2, 3);  // Usage of the function
    return 0;
}

// Definition (actual implementation)
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```
- The **declaration** allows `main()` to call `add` before its actual definition.
- The **definition** provides the actual logic for `add` to perform the operation.

---

**Question 8:**  
**How do you call a simple function that takes no parameters and returns `void` in C++?**

**Answer:**  
To call a simple function that takes no parameters and returns `void`, you would simply use the function's name followed by empty parentheses `()`.

### Example:

Assume the function is defined like this:

```cpp
void displayMessage() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
}
```

To **call** this function, you would do:

```cpp
displayMessage();  // Calling the function
```

### Full Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Function definition
void displayMessage() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    displayMessage();  // Calling the function in main
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- `displayMessage()` is the function name.
- `()` indicates that the function takes no parameters.
- The function does not return any value because its return type is `void`, so we simply call it without expecting a return value.

**Question 9:**  
**What is the concept of scope in the context of a function in C++?**

**Answer:**  
In C++, **scope** refers to the region of the code where a variable or function is accessible or valid. In the context of a function, scope determines where variables, parameters, and functions can be used within the program. The scope can be broken down into several types, including **local scope** and **global scope**.

### Types of Scope in Functions:

1. **Local Scope**:
   - A variable or function that is defined within a function (or block of code, like a loop or conditional) has **local scope**. It is only accessible and valid within that function or block.
   - Once the function or block of code finishes executing, the local variable or function goes out of scope and is no longer accessible.
   
   **Example of local scope:**
   ```cpp
   void myFunction() {
       int localVariable = 10;  // localVariable has local scope within myFunction
       std::cout << localVariable << std::endl;  // Works fine
   }

   int main() {
       // std::cout << localVariable << std::endl; // Error: localVariable is not accessible here
       myFunction();
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - In this example, `localVariable` is only accessible within `myFunction` and is not accessible in `main()`.

2. **Global Scope**:
   - A function or variable declared outside of any function, typically at the top of the program, has **global scope**. It can be accessed by any function within the program, as long as it is not shadowed by a local variable with the same name.
   
   **Example of global scope:**
   ```cpp
   int globalVariable = 20;  // globalVariable has global scope

   void myFunction() {
       std::cout << globalVariable << std::endl;  // Accesses global variable
   }

   int main() {
       std::cout << globalVariable << std::endl;  // Accesses global variable
       myFunction();
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - In this case, `globalVariable` can be accessed both in `main()` and `myFunction()` because it has global scope.

### Function Scope:

In the case of functions, the scope refers to where the function can be called or accessed. A function is typically **globally scoped** in C++ if it is defined outside any other function, which allows it to be called from anywhere in the program (unless restricted by access control, like private or protected access in classes).

**Function Scope Example:**
```cpp
void displayMessage() {
    std::cout << "Hello from function!" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    displayMessage();  // Function can be called here
    return 0;
}
```
- `displayMessage()` is globally scoped and can be called from `main()` because it is defined outside any other functions.

### Shadowing:
Sometimes, a variable or function in a local scope can "shadow" or hide a variable or function with the same name from a higher (broader) scope. This means that within the local scope, the local variable or function will take precedence.

**Example of shadowing:**
```cpp
int x = 10;  // Global x

void myFunction() {
    int x = 20;  // Local x shadows global x
    std::cout << x << std::endl;  // Prints local x, which is 20
}

int main() {
    myFunction();
    std::cout << x << std::endl;  // Prints global x, which is 10
    return 0;
}
```
- The `x` inside `myFunction` shadows the global `x`, so when `x` is printed inside the function, it prints the local version (`20`). Outside the function, the global `x` is still accessible (`10`).

### Conclusion:
- **Local scope**: Variables or functions defined within a function are accessible only inside that function.
- **Global scope**: Variables or functions defined outside any function are accessible globally throughout the program, unless shadowed by local definitions.
- **Function scope**: A function can be called throughout the program if it is globally defined and not within a restricted scope.

Understanding scope helps prevent naming conflicts and ensures that variables and functions are used only where they are intended to be accessible.

**Question 10:**  
**What is call by reference in C++?**

**Answer:**  
**Call by reference** in C++ is a method of passing arguments to a function such that the function can modify the actual variables in the calling function. Instead of passing a copy of the argument, a reference (or address) to the original variable is passed, allowing the function to directly modify the value of the original variable.

In **call by reference**, the formal parameters in the function receive the **reference** of the actual arguments. This means that any change made to the parameter inside the function will affect the actual argument.

### Syntax:
To pass a parameter by reference, you use the **reference operator** `&` in the function's parameter list.

```cpp
void functionName(type &parameter) {
    // Function body
}
```

### Example of Call by Reference:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function that takes an integer by reference
void increaseValue(int &x) {
    x = x + 5;  // Modifies the original variable
}

int main() {
    int num = 10;
    cout << "Before function call: " << num << endl;
    increaseValue(num);  // Pass by reference
    cout << "After function call: " << num << endl;  // Value of num has changed
    return 0;
}
```

### Output:
```
Before function call: 10
After function call: 15
```

### Explanation:
- In the above example, `increaseValue(num)` is called with `num` passed by reference.
- Inside the function, the value of `num` is modified directly.
- The change reflects in the `main()` function because the argument is passed by reference, and no copy of the argument is made. The function operates on the original variable.

### Advantages of Call by Reference:
1. **Efficiency**: Passing large objects or arrays by reference avoids the overhead of copying the entire data.
2. **Direct Modification**: Since the function works directly with the original data, it can modify the values, which can be useful for tasks like sorting, updating multiple variables, or performing calculations on original data.

### Key Points:
- Call by reference is achieved using the reference operator (`&`) in the function’s parameter list.
- Changes made to parameters inside the function affect the original variables outside the function.
- It is useful when we want to modify multiple variables or work with large data structures efficiently.

### Difference from Call by Value:
- **Call by value**: The function works with a copy of the argument, and any changes inside the function do not affect the original variable.
- **Call by reference**: The function works with the original argument, so changes inside the function will modify the original variable.

---

**Question 11:**  
**How does call by reference differ from call by value in C++?**

**Answer:**  
In C++, **call by value** and **call by reference** are two different methods of passing arguments to a function. They differ primarily in how the function interacts with the arguments passed to it.

### 1. **Call by Value**:
- **Definition**: In **call by value**, a **copy** of the argument is passed to the function. The function works with this copy, and any changes made to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original argument.
  
- **Behavior**: The function only has access to the copy of the value, not the original variable. Therefore, modifications to the parameter will not affect the original variable in the calling function.

- **Syntax**: No special syntax is needed; this is the default method for passing arguments.

**Example of Call by Value:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void increaseValue(int x) {
    x = x + 5;  // Modifies the local copy, not the original variable
}

int main() {
    int num = 10;
    cout << "Before function call: " << num << endl;
    increaseValue(num);  // Pass by value
    cout << "After function call: " << num << endl;  // The original num remains unchanged
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Before function call: 10
After function call: 10
```

- **Explanation**: In this example, `num` is passed to `increaseValue()` by value. The function works with a copy of `num`, so any changes made to `x` inside the function do not affect the original `num` in `main()`.

---

### 2. **Call by Reference**:
- **Definition**: In **call by reference**, a **reference** to the original variable is passed to the function. The function works directly with the original variable, and any changes made to the parameter will affect the original argument in the calling function.
  
- **Behavior**: The function operates on the actual variable, not a copy. This means any changes made to the parameter will reflect in the calling function.

- **Syntax**: The reference operator (`&`) is used in the function's parameter list to specify that the argument is passed by reference.

**Example of Call by Reference:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void increaseValue(int &x) {
    x = x + 5;  // Modifies the original variable
}

int main() {
    int num = 10;
    cout << "Before function call: " << num << endl;
    increaseValue(num);  // Pass by reference
    cout << "After function call: " << num << endl;  // The original num is changed
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Before function call: 10
After function call: 15
```

- **Explanation**: Here, `num` is passed by reference to `increaseValue()`. The function directly modifies the original `num`, so the change is reflected in `main()`.

---

### Key Differences:

| **Aspect**               | **Call by Value**                                      | **Call by Reference**                              |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **What is passed**        | A **copy** of the argument (value is passed).          | A **reference** to the actual variable (address).  |
| **Modification of Argument** | Changes made inside the function do **not** affect the original variable. | Changes made inside the function **do** affect the original variable. |
| **Memory Usage**          | Uses more memory because a copy of the argument is created. | More memory-efficient because no copy is made.    |
| **Function Signature**    | No special syntax needed; parameters are passed normally. | Use the reference operator (`&`) in the parameter list. |
| **Performance**           | Slower for large data (e.g., large arrays or objects) because a copy is made. | Faster for large data as no copying occurs.       |
| **Default in C++**        | Call by value is the default method of passing arguments. | Call by reference requires explicit use of `&`.   |

---

### When to Use Each:
- **Call by Value**: Use when you do not need to modify the original variable, or when the argument is small (e.g., basic data types like `int`, `char`).
- **Call by Reference**: Use when you want to modify the original variable, or when you are passing large data (e.g., arrays or large objects), as it avoids the overhead of copying.

### Summary:
- **Call by Value**: Passes a copy of the argument; changes don't affect the original variable.
- **Call by Reference**: Passes a reference to the original variable; changes directly affect the original argument.

---

**Question 12:**  
**Can you provide an example of a function that uses call by reference to swap two integers in C++?**

**Answer:**  
Certainly! Below is an example of a C++ function that uses **call by reference** to swap two integers. This function will modify the original values of the integers in the calling function.

### Example: Swap Two Integers Using Call by Reference

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to swap two integers using call by reference
void swap(int &a, int &b) {
    int temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}

int main() {
    int num1 = 5, num2 = 10;
    
    cout << "Before swapping: num1 = " << num1 << ", num2 = " << num2 << endl;
    
    // Call the swap function
    swap(num1, num2);
    
    cout << "After swapping: num1 = " << num1 << ", num2 = " << num2 << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Output:
```
Before swapping: num1 = 5, num2 = 10
After swapping: num1 = 10, num2 = 5
```

### Explanation:
- **Function `swap(int &a, int &b)`**: 
   - The function takes two integer parameters by reference (`&a` and `&b`), meaning the actual memory addresses of the variables are passed.
   - Inside the function, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped using a temporary variable `temp`.
- **In `main()`**:
   - The integers `num1` and `num2` are initialized.
   - The `swap` function is called, and since the parameters are passed by reference, the values of `num1` and `num2` are directly modified in the function.

This example demonstrates how call by reference allows changes to the original variables (`num1` and `num2`) from within the `swap` function.

---

**Question 13:**  
**What is an inline function in C++?**

**Answer:**  
An **inline function** in C++ is a function that is defined with the `inline` keyword before its declaration. The main purpose of using inline functions is to improve performance by suggesting to the compiler to replace the function call with the actual code of the function, thus avoiding the overhead of a function call (such as stack operations, jumping to the function address, etc.).

When you use the `inline` keyword, you're requesting the compiler to insert the function's code directly into the place where the function is called, instead of performing the usual function call mechanism. However, it is up to the compiler to decide whether to actually inline the function or not, based on various factors such as the function's size and complexity.

### Syntax of an Inline Function:

```cpp
inline returnType functionName(parameterList) {
    // Function body
}
```

### Example of Inline Function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Inline function to calculate the square of a number
inline int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    cout << "Square of " << num << " is " << square(num) << endl;  // Function call
    return 0;
}
```

### Output:
```
Square of 5 is 25
```

### Explanation:
- **Inline Function Declaration**: The function `square` is declared as `inline` and calculates the square of a number.
- **Function Call**: The compiler will replace `square(num)` with `num * num` during compilation, thus eliminating the function call overhead.

### Benefits of Inline Functions:
1. **Performance Improvement**: By avoiding the overhead of function calls (e.g., stack pushing and popping), inline functions can improve performance, especially for small functions that are called frequently.
2. **Convenience**: They can be defined directly in the header file, making them suitable for small functions that are used often in a program.

### Limitations and Considerations:
1. **Code Size**: If the inline function is large or used many times, it can lead to code bloat, as the function's code is replicated wherever it is called. This could actually degrade performance.
2. **Compiler Discretion**: The compiler may choose not to inline a function even if it is marked as `inline`, particularly if the function is too complex or large.
3. **Recursive Functions**: Inline functions should not be used for recursive functions, as the compiler cannot replace recursive calls with the function body effectively.

### When to Use Inline Functions:
- **Small Functions**: Inline functions are most beneficial for small, simple functions (like getters/setters or mathematical calculations) that are called frequently.
- **Performance Optimization**: Use inline functions when you need to reduce the overhead of function calls in performance-critical applications.

### Summary:
An inline function in C++ is a function that is declared with the `inline` keyword, and it is expanded at the point of the function call by the compiler, which can lead to performance improvements. However, it should be used carefully, especially for small functions, as large inline functions can increase the size of the binary.

**Question 14:**  
**How do inline functions improve performance in C++?**

**Answer:**  
Inline functions can improve performance in C++ by **eliminating the overhead of function calls**, which can be particularly beneficial for small, frequently called functions. Here's how inline functions help improve performance:

### 1. **Eliminating Function Call Overhead**:
Normally, when a function is called, several operations are involved:
- **Passing arguments** to the function (potentially placing them in registers or on the stack).
- **Jumping** to the function's memory address.
- **Pushing and popping** values to and from the call stack.
- **Returning** from the function after execution.

This process takes time and adds overhead, particularly when the function is very small and simple (e.g., a function that just adds two numbers). Inline functions help reduce this overhead by **replacing the function call** with the actual **function body** directly at the point of the call.

### 2. **Code Substitution**:
When you declare a function as `inline`, the compiler attempts to **substitute the function's code directly** at the location of the function call during compilation, rather than performing a traditional function call.

For example, instead of doing:
```cpp
int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

int result = square(5);  // Traditional function call
```
The compiler may replace `square(5)` with:
```cpp
int result = 5 * 5;
```

### 3. **Reduced Function Call Overhead**:
For small functions, the overhead of calling a function can be significant compared to the actual execution of the function. By inlining the function, we avoid:
- **Pushing arguments onto the stack**.
- **Jumping to the function’s address**.
- **Popping values off the stack**.
- **Performing the return operation**.

### 4. **Improved Caching**:
In some cases, inlining can improve **cache locality**. When the function code is directly placed at the point of the call, it can be more likely to fit into the processor's instruction cache, which can result in faster execution.

### Example: Without Inline vs. With Inline

#### Without Inline:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    int result = square(num);  // Function call overhead
    cout << "Square of " << num << " is " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#### With Inline:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

inline int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    int result = num * num;  // Inlined code, no function call overhead
    cout << "Square of " << num << " is " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### 5. **Improved Performance in Small Functions**:
For **small functions** that perform simple operations, such as arithmetic, accessing a member variable, or returning a constant value, the overhead of calling the function might be more significant than the work done inside the function. Inlining eliminates this overhead, which can lead to noticeable performance improvements, especially in tight loops or frequently called functions.

### Limitations of Inline Functions for Performance:
While inline functions can improve performance, there are some things to be aware of:
1. **Code Bloat**: If the function is inlined multiple times (e.g., it’s called in many places), the code size may increase because the function's code is duplicated at each call site. This could lead to cache misses and reduced performance.
   
2. **Large Functions**: Inlining large functions is generally not beneficial. The overhead of copying a large function's body multiple times can outweigh the benefits, and modern compilers may ignore the `inline` keyword for larger functions.

3. **Compiler's Decision**: While you can suggest to the compiler to use `inline`, the compiler may choose not to inline a function, especially if it determines that inlining would not be beneficial (e.g., for recursive functions or large functions).

### Summary:
Inline functions improve performance by eliminating the overhead of function calls. Instead of performing a typical function call, the compiler inserts the function's code directly at the point of use, leading to faster execution, especially for small and frequently called functions. However, they should be used judiciously to avoid issues such as code bloat or reduced performance for larger functions.

**Question 15:**  
**What is the syntax for declaring an inline function in C++?**

**Answer:**  
The syntax for declaring an **inline function** in C++ is straightforward. You simply add the `inline` keyword before the function's return type in the function declaration. Here’s the basic syntax:

### General Syntax:
```cpp
inline returnType functionName(parameterList) {
    // Function body
}
```

- **`inline`**: The keyword that suggests to the compiler to replace the function call with the function code at the call site (though it is up to the compiler to decide whether to inline the function).
- **`returnType`**: The data type that the function returns (e.g., `int`, `void`, `double`, etc.).
- **`functionName`**: The name of the function.
- **`parameterList`**: A list of parameters that the function takes (if any). It can be empty if the function does not take parameters.
- **Function body**: The actual code that defines the function's behavior.

### Example 1: Inline Function with Parameters

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Inline function to calculate the square of a number
inline int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    cout << "Square of " << num << " is " << square(num) << endl;  // Function call
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- The function `square(int x)` is declared as `inline` before the return type (`int`).
- The function takes a parameter `x` and returns its square.
- When `square(num)` is called, the compiler may replace the call with the actual code `num * num` at the point of call, thus avoiding the overhead of a traditional function call.

### Example 2: Inline Function Without Parameters

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Inline function that returns a constant value
inline int getFive() {
    return 5;
}

int main() {
    cout << "The number is: " << getFive() << endl;  // Function call
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- The function `getFive()` is declared as `inline` and returns a constant value `5`.
- When the function is called, the compiler may substitute `getFive()` with `5`, making the call faster by eliminating the function call overhead.

### Notes on Inline Functions:
1. **Header Files**: Inline functions are often defined in header files because they need to be included wherever they are used. This allows the compiler to replace function calls with the function body at compile time.
   
2. **Function Definition**: In C++, you can define the inline function either inside the class definition (if it's a member function) or outside of the class using the `inline` keyword.

### Example: Inline Member Function (inside class definition)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Rectangle {
public:
    int width, height;

    // Inline member function to calculate area
    inline int area() {
        return width * height;
    }
};

int main() {
    Rectangle rect;
    rect.width = 10;
    rect.height = 5;

    cout << "Area of rectangle: " << rect.area() << endl;  // Inline member function
    return 0;
}
```

### Summary:
- To declare an inline function in C++, simply use the `inline` keyword before the return type in the function declaration.
- The function body is inserted at the call site, avoiding the overhead of function calls, which can improve performance, especially for small functions.
- The compiler decides whether or not to inline the function based on various factors such as the function's complexity and size.

**Question 16:**  
**What are macros in C++ and how are they different from inline functions?**

**Answer:**

### **What are Macros in C++?**

A **macro** in C++ is a preprocessor directive that defines a piece of code that is replaced by another piece of code before the compilation process begins. Macros are typically defined using the `#define` directive. The preprocessor performs a **textual substitution**, meaning that wherever the macro is used in the code, the preprocessor replaces it with the macro's definition.

### Syntax for Defining a Macro:
```cpp
#define MACRO_NAME replacement_code
```

- **`MACRO_NAME`**: The name of the macro that is used as a placeholder in the code.
- **`replacement_code`**: The actual code that will replace the macro name when the program is compiled.

### Example of a Macro:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Macro to calculate the square of a number
#define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    cout << "Square of " << num << " is " << SQUARE(num) << endl;  // Macro substitution
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- The `#define` directive defines a macro `SQUARE(x)` which calculates the square of `x`.
- Whenever `SQUARE(num)` is used, the preprocessor replaces it with `((num) * (num))` before compilation.
- The macro `SQUARE(x)` does not have any type checking and is a simple text substitution.

### **Difference Between Macros and Inline Functions**

While both **macros** and **inline functions** are used to optimize code by reducing the overhead of function calls, they work in fundamentally different ways. Here's a comparison of **macros** and **inline functions**:

| **Aspect**                   | **Macro**                                   | **Inline Function**                             |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**                | Defined using the `#define` directive.      | Defined using the `inline` keyword.             |
| **Expansion**                 | Macro is a **textual substitution** before compilation. | Function code is inserted at the point of the call (via compiler). |
| **Type Safety**               | No type checking is done; it can lead to unexpected results. | Type checking is done, ensuring safer code.    |
| **Debugging**                 | Harder to debug, as macros don’t provide function-level stack traces. | Easier to debug because inline functions are real functions with a stack trace. |
| **Evaluation of Arguments**   | Arguments may be evaluated multiple times, leading to side effects. | Arguments are evaluated only once, ensuring no side effects. |
| **Usage**                     | Typically used for constants, small operations, and code that needs to be expanded at many places. | Typically used for small functions that would benefit from being inlined (avoiding function call overhead). |
| **Scope**                     | Macros have **global scope** and can be used anywhere after they are defined. | Inline functions have **local scope** (can be defined within classes or in specific files). |
| **Performance**               | Macros can be faster because of direct substitution, but may lead to code bloat and errors if used incorrectly. | Inline functions are more controlled by the compiler and can lead to better optimization without code bloat. |

### **Examples Comparing Macros and Inline Functions**

#### 1. **Macro Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Macro to calculate square
#define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    cout << "Square of " << a << " is " << SQUARE(a) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

- The macro `SQUARE(x)` directly replaces `SQUARE(a)` with `((a) * (a))`, resulting in `5 * 5`.

#### 2. **Inline Function Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Inline function to calculate square
inline int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    cout << "Square of " << a << " is " << square(a) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

- The inline function `square(int x)` will be replaced by the code `x * x` during compilation, but it is still a function, providing type checking and better debugging.

### **Key Differences:**

1. **Textual Substitution vs. Function Call**:
   - A **macro** is replaced by a simple text substitution during preprocessing, meaning the code is expanded in place.
   - An **inline function** is still a function, but the compiler attempts to **insert** the function body directly at the point of the call.

2. **Type Checking**:
   - **Macros** do not perform type checking. This can lead to errors if you use them incorrectly (e.g., passing a non-numeric value to a macro).
   - **Inline functions** are **type-safe** since they are functions, and the compiler performs type checking.

3. **Arguments Evaluation**:
   - In **macros**, arguments are evaluated **multiple times**. For example, `SQUARE(x+1)` will result in `((x+1) * (x+1))`, which means `x+1` will be evaluated twice, potentially leading to side effects (e.g., incrementing `x`).
   - In **inline functions**, arguments are evaluated **once** (avoiding the multiple evaluations issue).

4. **Debugging**:
   - Debugging **macros** is more difficult because they do not have function-level stack traces.
   - **Inline functions** behave like regular functions, so they can be debugged more easily.

5. **Scope**:
   - **Macros** are globally available throughout the file after they are defined, which can sometimes cause naming conflicts.
   - **Inline functions** are typically scoped within the class or the file they are defined in.

### **Summary:**
- **Macros** provide **textual substitution** and are faster but lack type safety and can be prone to errors (e.g., multiple evaluations of arguments).
- **Inline functions** are real functions with **type checking** and better debugging support, and they provide safer and more efficient performance optimizations than macros.
  
While both can be used for performance improvements, **inline functions** are generally preferred over **macros** because they offer better type safety and debugging features.

**Question 17:**  
**What are the advantages and disadvantages of using macros over inline functions?**

**Answer:**

Both **macros** and **inline functions** serve similar purposes, such as improving performance by eliminating function call overhead, but they have distinct characteristics. Here’s a detailed look at the **advantages** and **disadvantages** of using **macros** instead of **inline functions**:

### **Advantages of Using Macros Over Inline Functions:**

1. **Faster Substitution (No Function Call Overhead):**
   - Macros perform a **direct textual substitution** before compilation, so there is **no function call overhead**. This can make them faster than inline functions in certain contexts, especially for very simple operations (like constants or small arithmetic).
   - Example: 
     ```cpp
     #define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))
     ```

2. **Works for Any Type (No Type Restrictions):**
   - Macros are **not restricted by types**. They can be used for all kinds of text-based substitutions, including constants, simple expressions, or even code blocks, which makes them more flexible than inline functions.
   - This means that you can use macros for anything, whether it's defining constants, defining simple expressions, or even more complex code like logging or debugging macros.

3. **No Need for a Function Definition:**
   - Macros do not require a **function definition** or separate function call, which makes them easier to define in cases where you want to reuse simple logic across multiple places in the code without worrying about the overhead of creating a formal function.
   - For example, you can define simple operations like:
     ```cpp
     #define MAX(a, b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))
     ```

4. **Flexibility with Conditional Compilation:**
   - Macros can be used for **conditional compilation**. For example, using `#ifdef`, `#define`, and `#endif`, you can control which parts of the code are compiled based on certain conditions or platform-specific code.
   - This is something that inline functions cannot do directly.

5. **No Need for Compiler Support for Inline Behavior:**
   - Macros do not rely on compiler optimization (i.e., inlining). The preprocessor simply substitutes the code, so the inline function optimization is not needed. This means macros will **always be substituted**, regardless of the complexity or size of the macro.

6. **Simple to Use:**
   - Macros are typically easier to write and use for simple **expressions** or code snippets. They don't require defining the function prototype or worrying about scope or type safety, which makes them particularly convenient for very small, repetitive tasks.

---

### **Disadvantages of Using Macros Over Inline Functions:**

1. **Lack of Type Safety:**
   - **Macros do not perform type checking**, meaning that they can potentially lead to **type mismatches** or **unexpected behavior**. Since the macro is expanded before compilation, there is no way to ensure that the correct types are passed to the macro.
   - For instance, calling `SQUARE("hello")` or passing an unsupported type to a macro can cause problems that are hard to detect until runtime.

2. **Multiple Evaluations of Arguments (Side Effects):**
   - **Macros evaluate their arguments multiple times**, which can lead to **side effects** if the argument involves an expression with a side effect (like `i++` or `x = 5`).
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     #define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))
     int i = 5;
     SQUARE(i++);  // i is incremented twice
     ```
     Here, `i++` will be evaluated twice, causing unexpected results.

3. **Difficult to Debug:**
   - **Macros are not real functions**, so they do not have function call stacks or other debugging features. When an error occurs, it's hard to pinpoint exactly where in the macro the error lies.
   - If a macro is complex or used incorrectly, debugging becomes tricky because you can’t directly step through the macro's execution like a function.

4. **Global Scope (Potential Naming Conflicts):**
   - Macros are defined globally and can clash with other identifiers or variable names, especially in large codebases or when using external libraries.
   - For instance:
     ```cpp
     #define MAX(a, b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))  // Can conflict with MAX() in other libraries
     ```
   - This can cause **naming conflicts**, and it’s easy to inadvertently override an existing macro or variable.

5. **No Function Semantics (No Return Type or Scope Control):**
   - Macros do not have **return types** or **scopes**, which means you lose the control and structure provided by actual functions. This can lead to **unexpected results** when macro names are reused or expanded improperly.
   - Inline functions can be scoped within a specific file, class, or namespace, giving you **better control** over their use.

6. **No Compiler Optimization for Recursion:**
   - Unlike inline functions, **macros cannot handle recursion** effectively. If a recursive macro is defined, the preprocessor will keep expanding it endlessly, causing an infinite loop.

7. **Code Bloat:**
   - While macros can reduce overhead by replacing function calls, if a macro is used **many times** in different places with different arguments, it can lead to **code bloat** as the same code gets repeated in multiple places in the program. This can increase the binary size and reduce the cache efficiency.

8. **No Debugging Symbols:**
   - Since macros are expanded at preprocessing time and not during the actual program execution, **debugging symbols** will not show the macro name in the call stack, making it difficult to trace where a particular piece of code came from in the source.

---

### **Summary of Advantages and Disadvantages:**

| **Aspect**                     | **Macros**                                        | **Inline Functions**                                |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Performance**                 | No function call overhead, but may lead to code bloat. | Reduces function call overhead, but may cause code bloat if overused. |
| **Type Safety**                 | No type safety, can lead to errors.               | Type-safe, prevents errors from invalid arguments.  |
| **Argument Evaluation**         | Arguments are evaluated multiple times, leading to side effects. | Arguments are evaluated once, no side effects.     |
| **Debugging**                   | Difficult to debug, no debugging support.         | Easier to debug, supports debugging tools.         |
| **Scope**                       | Global scope, prone to naming conflicts.          | Local scope, controlled by the programmer.         |
| **Usage**                       | Flexible, works for any text-based substitution.  | Suitable for small, simple functions.              |
| **Error Detection**             | Errors can be difficult to detect.                | Errors are easier to detect at compile time.       |
| **Function Semantics**          | No function return type or structure.             | Full function semantics (return type, scope).      |

### **When to Use Macros:**
- When you need **simple, repetitive code** that doesn’t require type safety, such as defining constants, simple mathematical operations, or conditional compilation.
- When you need **flexibility** in substituting expressions or creating reusable code snippets that aren’t tied to any particular type or function structure.
- In performance-critical situations where **function call overhead** must be eliminated, and the macro is extremely simple.

### **When to Use Inline Functions:**
- When you need **type safety** and avoid potential side effects.
- When you want **easier debugging** and better error detection.
- For small functions where you want to **avoid function call overhead** but still maintain the structure and benefits of a true function.

---

### **Conclusion:**
- **Macros** are **fast** and flexible, making them useful for simple operations and code that needs to be expanded at compile time. However, they come with the cost of being **harder to debug**, prone to **side effects**, and lack **type safety**.
- **Inline functions**, while potentially leading to **code bloat**, provide **type safety**, **easier debugging**, and **better scope control**. Therefore, they are generally preferred over macros for most small function-like tasks that benefit from inlining.

**Question 18:** **Provide an example to illustrate the differences between macros and inline functions.**  

**Answer:**  

Sure! Below is an example illustrating the differences between macros and inline functions in C++.  

### **Using a Macro**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

#define SQUARE(x) (x * x)  // Macro definition

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    std::cout << "Macro SQUARE(5): " << SQUARE(a) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Macro SQUARE(5+1): " << SQUARE(a + 1) << std::endl;  // Issue here
    return 0;
}
```
**Problem with Macros:**  
- **No Type Checking**: Macros don’t check data types, which can lead to unexpected behavior.  
- **Unexpected Expansion**: The second call `SQUARE(a + 1)` expands to `(a + 1 * a + 1)`, which is incorrect.  

### **Using an Inline Function**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

inline int square(int x) {  // Inline function definition
    return x * x;
}

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    std::cout << "Inline Function square(5): " << square(a) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Inline Function square(5+1): " << square(a + 1) << std::endl;  // Correct result
    return 0;
}
```
**Advantages of Inline Functions:**  
- **Type Safety**: Functions perform type checking.  
- **No Unexpected Expansion**: The function correctly evaluates `square(a + 1)`.  
- **Better Debugging**: Inline functions provide better error messages and debugging compared to macros.  

Thus, **inline functions are safer and more reliable** than macros for simple operations like computing squares.

---

**Question 19:** **What is function overloading in C++?**  

**Answer:**  

**Function overloading** in C++ is a feature that allows multiple functions to have the same name but different parameter lists (different number or types of parameters). The compiler differentiates these functions based on their signatures.  

### **Example of Function Overloading:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Function to add two integers
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

// Function to add two floating-point numbers
double add(double a, double b) {
    return a + b;
}

// Function to add three integers
int add(int a, int b, int c) {
    return a + b + c;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << "Addition of two integers: " << add(5, 10) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Addition of two doubles: " << add(5.5, 2.2) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Addition of three integers: " << add(3, 4, 5) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
### **Key Points:**
- Functions with the **same name** but **different parameter lists** can exist in the same scope.  
- The **return type is not considered** for overloading; only the parameter list matters.  
- Function overloading improves **code readability and maintainability**.  

This is an example of **compile-time polymorphism** in C++.

---

**Question 20:** **How does the compiler differentiate between overloaded functions?**  

**Answer:**  

The **C++ compiler differentiates between overloaded functions** using their **function signatures**, which consist of:  
1. **Number of parameters**  
2. **Types of parameters**  
3. **Order of parameters**  

The **return type is NOT considered** when distinguishing overloaded functions.  

### **Example: Function Overloading and Differentiation**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Function with one integer parameter
void display(int a) {
    std::cout << "Integer: " << a << std::endl;
}

// Function with one double parameter
void display(double a) {
    std::cout << "Double: " << a << std::endl;
}

// Function with two parameters (int, double)
void display(int a, double b) {
    std::cout << "Integer and Double: " << a << ", " << b << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    display(10);       // Calls display(int)
    display(3.14);     // Calls display(double)
    display(5, 2.71);  // Calls display(int, double)
    return 0;
}
```
### **How the Compiler Differentiates:**
1. `display(10);` → Matches `void display(int)`  
2. `display(3.14);` → Matches `void display(double)`  
3. `display(5, 2.71);` → Matches `void display(int, double)`  

If two functions have the **same signature**, a **compiler error occurs** due to ambiguity.

**Question 21:** **Provide an example of overloaded functions in C++.**  

**Answer:**  

Here is an example of **function overloading** in C++:  

### **Example: Function Overloading**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Function to print an integer
void print(int a) {
    std::cout << "Integer: " << a << std::endl;
}

// Function to print a double
void print(double a) {
    std::cout << "Double: " << a << std::endl;
}

// Function to print a string
void print(std::string a) {
    std::cout << "String: " << a << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    print(10);        // Calls print(int)
    print(3.14);      // Calls print(double)
    print("Hello");   // Calls print(string)
    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation:**
- The function `print()` is **overloaded** three times with different parameter types:  
  - **`int`**
  - **`double`**
  - **`std::string`**  
- The compiler determines which function to call based on the **argument type** passed.  

This demonstrates **function overloading**, a key feature of **compile-time polymorphism** in C++.

**Question 22:** **What are default arguments in C++?**  

**Answer:**  

**Default arguments** in C++ allow a function to have **predefined values** for parameters. If an argument is not provided when calling the function, the default value is used.  

### **Example of Default Arguments:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Function with default arguments
void greet(std::string name = "Guest", int age = 18) {
    std::cout << "Hello, " << name << "! You are " << age << " years old." << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    greet();                   // Uses both default values: "Guest", 18
    greet("Alice");            // Uses default age: 18
    greet("Bob", 25);          // Uses provided values: "Bob", 25
    return 0;
}
```
### **Output:**
```
Hello, Guest! You are 18 years old.
Hello, Alice! You are 18 years old.
Hello, Bob! You are 25 years old.
```
### **Key Points:**
- Default values are **defined in the function declaration** or **definition**.  
- Parameters with default values **must be placed at the end** of the parameter list.  
- Helps in **reducing function overloading** when minor variations are needed.  

Default arguments **increase flexibility** and make function calls **simpler and more readable**.

---

**Question 23:** **How do you specify default arguments in a function declaration?**  

**Answer:**  

In C++, **default arguments** are specified in the **function declaration** by assigning default values to parameters.  

### **Syntax:**  
```cpp
return_type function_name(parameter1 = default_value1, parameter2 = default_value2, ...);
```
- Default arguments must be specified **from right to left** in the parameter list.  

### **Example: Specifying Default Arguments in a Function Declaration**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Function declaration with default arguments
void displayMessage(std::string message = "Hello, World!", int count = 1);

int main() {
    displayMessage();             // Uses both default arguments
    displayMessage("Hi there!");  // Uses default count = 1
    displayMessage("C++ Rocks!", 3);  // Uses both provided values
    return 0;
}

// Function definition (no default arguments here)
void displayMessage(std::string message, int count) {
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        std::cout << message << std::endl;
    }
}
```
### **Key Points:**
1. **Default values are specified only in the function declaration** (not in the definition).  
2. **Rightmost parameters must have default values first** (e.g., `count = 1` follows `message = "Hello, World!"`).  
3. If arguments are provided in the function call, they **override** the default values.  

This technique helps in **reducing function overloading** and makes function calls more flexible.

**Question 24: ** **What are the rules for using default arguments in functions?**  

**Answer:**  

When using **default arguments** in C++, the following rules must be followed:  

### **1. Default arguments must be specified from right to left**  
- Once a parameter has a default value, all parameters to its **right must also have default values**.  
✅ **Valid:**  
```cpp
void func(int a, int b = 10, int c = 20);  // Allowed
```
❌ **Invalid:**  
```cpp
void func(int a = 5, int b, int c = 20);  // Not allowed (b has no default)
```

### **2. Default arguments are specified in function declarations, not definitions**  
✅ **Valid:**  
```cpp
void greet(std::string name = "Guest");  // Default argument in declaration

void greet(std::string name) {  // No default argument in definition
    std::cout << "Hello, " << name << "!" << std::endl;
}
```
❌ **Invalid:**  
```cpp
void greet(std::string name);  // No default in declaration

void greet(std::string name = "Guest") {  // Default in definition (not allowed)
    std::cout << "Hello, " << name << "!" << std::endl;
}
```

### **3. Function calls override default values if arguments are provided**  
```cpp
void greet(std::string name = "Guest") {
    std::cout << "Hello, " << name << "!" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    greet();         // Uses default: "Guest"
    greet("Alice");  // Overrides default, prints "Hello, Alice!"
}
```

### **4. Default arguments can be used with function overloading**  
- A function can have both overloaded versions and default arguments.  
```cpp
void display(int x = 10) {  // Default argument version
    std::cout << "Value: " << x << std::endl;
}

void display(std::string str) {  // Overloaded function
    std::cout << "String: " << str << std::endl;
}
```

### **5. Default arguments can be used in constructors**  
```cpp
class Student {
public:
    Student(std::string name = "Unknown", int age = 18) {
        std::cout << "Name: " << name << ", Age: " << age << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s1;           // Uses default values
    Student s2("Alice");  // Overrides only name
    Student s3("Bob", 22); // Overrides both
}
```

### **Summary of Default Argument Rules:**
✅ **Must be specified from right to left**  
✅ **Declared in function declarations, not definitions**  
✅ **Function calls override defaults if values are provided**  
✅ **Can be combined with function overloading**  
✅ **Can be used in constructors**  

Default arguments make function calls more **flexible and concise**, reducing unnecessary overloads.

**Question 25:** **Provide an example of a function with default arguments.**  

**Answer:**  

Here is an example of a function using **default arguments** in C++:  

### **Example: Function with Default Arguments**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Function declaration with default arguments
void greet(std::string name = "Guest", int age = 18) {
    std::cout << "Hello, " << name << "! You are " << age << " years old." << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    greet();                 // Uses both default values: "Guest", 18
    greet("Alice");          // Uses default age: 18
    greet("Bob", 25);        // Uses both provided values
    return 0;
}
```

### **Output:**
```
Hello, Guest! You are 18 years old.
Hello, Alice! You are 18 years old.
Hello, Bob! You are 25 years old.
```

### **Explanation:**
- The function `greet()` has **two parameters** with **default values**:  
  - `name = "Guest"`  
  - `age = 18`  
- If no arguments are passed, the function **uses default values**.  
- If only one argument is passed, it **overrides** the first parameter while using the default for the second.  
- If both arguments are provided, it **uses the given values** instead of defaults.  

This makes function calls more **flexible and concise**.
